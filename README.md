# Fez-Puzzle-Solving

To practice my Python programming, I created a couple scripts to help me solve some puzzles in the game *Fez*. "FezAncientScriptTranslator.py" deciphers the language spoken in the game and renames the images I took of the text accordingly. "FezBookAnalysis" manipulates a 3D array of characters to uncover the message hidden within.
